## What is this repo for?
This repo contains all of the code written in the T09A tutorials this term


## How do I find something I'm looking for?
Don't panic! If you've never used github or a similar tool, click on the directories (folders) above and navigate to the right week and file. Once you find the file you're looking for, you should be able to click on it to see the C code.
To go back, click on the links in the path displayed above the directories, but below the header bar (Code,Issues, Pull Requests, etc.).
Slides for all weeks are located in the slides directory, and are uploaded following the tut as they change term-term sometimes.
Slides are in pdf format and should be viewable if you're in the viewer mode with "Files" in the top left corner of this window.

## If you have comments/feedback!
The weekly emails I send all have a link to the anonymous feedback form. I've used it to make changes to pacing, etc. and a few other things in previous terms (i.e. a student asked for slides, hence the slides directory on the repo).
It should only take a couple seconds to fill out, the one I especially care about is how you're all finding the pacing in the tut each week.
