# cs1511-23t3-h09c
This repo contains all of the code written in the H09C tutorials this term

Don't panic if you've never used github or a similar tool, click on the folders (directories) above and navigate to the right week and file. Once you find the file you're looking for, you should be able to click on it to see the C code.

To go back, click on the links in the path displayed above the directories, but below the header bar (Code, Issues, Pull Requests, etc.).

One important thing, I may use a different compiler to dcc (beyond scope of the course but it's gcc if you're interested), if I polish some code up at home before adding it here then please recompile rather than just running the binary in the folder, as there may be some differences in behaviour between the two compilers and I can't guarantee that I compiled just before pushing the code here.
