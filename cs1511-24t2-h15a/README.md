## What is this repo for?
# cs1511-24t2-h15a
This repo contains all of the code written in the H15A tutorials this term

## How do I find something I'm looking for?
Don't panic! If you've never used github or a similar tool, click on the folders (directories) above and navigate to the right week and file. Once you find the file you're looking for, you should be able to click on it to see the C code.
To go back, click on the links in the path displayed above the directories, but below the header bar (Code,Issues, Pull Requests, etc.).
Slides for all weeks are located in the slides folder, and are uploaded following the tut as they change term-term sometimes.
Slides are in pdf format and should be viewable if you're in the viewer mode with "Files" in the top left corner of this window.

## A note on Running Code
One important thing, I may use a different compiler to dcc (beyond scope of the course but it's gcc if you're interested), if I polish some code up at home before adding it here then please recompile rather than just running the binary in the folder, as there may be some differences in behaviour between the two compilers and I can't guarantee that I compiled just before pushing the code here.

## If you have comments/feedback!
The weekly emails I send all have a link to the anonymous feedback form. I've used it to make changes to pacing, etc. and a few other things in previous terms (i.e. a student asked for slides, hence the slides folder on the repo).
It should only take a couple seconds to fill out, the one I especially care about is how you're all finding the pacing in the tut each week.
